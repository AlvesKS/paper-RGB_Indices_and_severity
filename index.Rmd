<img src = "figs/rect3822.png" width = 250px align = right> In this website are available the codes used to reproduce the analysis and results of the research conducted by a D.sc student Kaique dos S. Alves under the supervision of Prof. Emerson Del Ponte, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

 We studied the relatioship between RGB-based spectral indices and leaf severity of five diseases and developed an automated approach for processing the leaf-images for predicting severity using boosting regression tree models.
